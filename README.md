# ASIAN PAINTS STOCK PRICE PREDICTION üìà

This **machine learning-based web application** predicts the **High, Low, and Closing prices** of Asian Paints stock based on the **previous closing price**. It is built using **Streamlit** and utilizes trained regression models.

---

## üìä About the Data
The dataset used for this project was sourced from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)** and contains historical stock price data of **Asian Paints Ltd.** from year **2000 to 2021** It includes the following features:
- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Volume
- Prev Close (engineered feature)

---

## üíª How It Works
1. Users input the **previous closing price** of the stock.
2. The application uses trained regression models to predict:
   - **High Price**
   - **Low Price**
   - **Closing Price**
3. The predictions are displayed with visualizations:
   - A **line plot** for stock prices.
   - A **bar chart** for comparison.
